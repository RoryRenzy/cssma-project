Hello,

My name is Rory Renzy and I am a PhD student in public policy at Georgia State University. I am currently conducting research on homeowners associations and have been researching data sources.

With its regulation under the Common-Interest Ownership Act, Nevada appears to have some of the best data available, especially given my interest in linking HOAs with their private management companies and HOAs in Sunbelt states..

I see that the Real Estate Division updates the HOAs registry Excel sheet monthly, but does the department have access to historical files for months and years past?

Part of my research interest is to track the change in HOAs and management company dominance. Therefore, having the same sort of data that is currently available over time would be wonderful.

I am happy to also submit a public records request if that is necessary.

Thank you in advance for your time and I look forward to hearing back soon.

Best,
Rory Renzy
